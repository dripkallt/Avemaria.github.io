            One of the key strengths of the Max Planck Institutes is their interdisciplinary approach to
            research. Scientists from different fields are encouraged to work together to tackle complex
            problems and to share their expertise and knowledge. This collaborative approach has led to 
            many groundbreaking discoveries and has helped to establish the Max Planck Society as a leader 
            in scientific research.
